# CfStatsForMultipleGroups

(NOT YET READY, Under development of plan and ideas)

Here we want to make an interface that could help a communtity of multiple groups to have stasticial(standings and rating changes) data for multiple groups in a pdf.


The interface idea is to get the followig content into pdf:
1) Contest details
2) Number of people who participated in the contest form each group
3) Stats of the top performances from each group.
4) Ranking based on points of people beloning to all group.
5) Ranking based on points of people beloning to individual group.
6) Rating changes of people for all group and individual groups.
7) Congradulation messages to those who increased the level.
8) Hmm what else could be included?
