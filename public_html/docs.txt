File you need to change:
    1. Under Dashboard/login/classesAndFunctions/dbAndOtherDetails.php
    2. You need to change the recaptch public key also.
        currently they are used at 9 positions
            1. 2 times - Under login/index.html for signup and login btns.
            2. Under Dashboard/index.html when Admin clicks on add group and in that window there is an add btn using recaptcha.
            3. Under /Dashboard/group/index.html when add members btn clicked in the windows there is an add btn using recaptcha.
            4. 5 times under /Dashboard/group/index.html when users selects options in option panel

To start using:-
    The code is desined to work in the following priniple:
        There should be an ADMINISTRATOR in the database.
            So first signup a user then in the databases of users explicitly put change the user type to "ADMINISTRATOR" without the quotes.
            (This is the last time you ever need to touch the database)
        
        There are three types of users with the following permissions:-
            1. NORMAL:
                    A NORMAL user can login and view the groups and users in the groups.
                    he is present is one group or no group, but not in multiple groups.

            2. GROUP_ADMIN:
                    A GROUP_ADMIN is a NORMAL user who is admin of the group.
                    There can be multiple admins for a group.

                    A GROUP_ADMIN can ADD/REMOVE a USER to his group.
                        ADD -> works only if the the person to be added is in no other group.

                    A GROUP_ADMIN can promote a NORMAL to GROUP_ADMIN of the group.
                        This works only if both the GROUP_ADMIN and the one being promoted belong to same group.

                    A GROUP_ADMIN can demote a GROUP_ADMIN to NORMAL user(INCLUDING HIMSELF).
                        This works only if both the GROUP_ADMIN and the one begin demoted is/are present in same group.

            3. ADMINISTRATOR:
                    An ADMINISTRATOR is a NORMAL user but with all the privileges as a GROUP_ADMIN for all the groups.
                    that is an ADMINISTRATOR can act like a GROUP_ADMIN in any group even if he is not present in the group.

                    An ADMINISTRATOR can create a GROUP.

                    An ADMINISTRATOR can promoted other users to ADMINISTRATOR.

                    An ADMINISTRATOR can demote an other ADMINISTRATOR (but not HIMSELF) to a NORMAL user.
                    (This thing ensures that there is at least one ADMINISTRATOR always present).
